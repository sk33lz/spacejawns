# Space Jawns
Space Jawns is a Unity3D game I am developing in C#. I will be open sourcing much of the underlying C# code that runs the game in an effort to help other aspiring video game developers to learn ways to build video game logic. I work with open source code and write documentation for a living, so it just feels right to share some code and document how to write Unity games in C# for this project.

## About This Repo
This repo contains both the open source tools and documentation I have written for Unity3D game development in relation to the Space Jawns game series, as well as the actual Space Jawns website.

## Support
Space Jawns is developed by myself, a single developer, so I rely on tools to help facilitate support for both development and gameplay issues.

<a href="https://github.com/sk33lz/spacejawns/issues/new" title="Create a new GitHub issue" target="_blank">Create a new GitHub Issue</a> to submit support requests, bugs, feature requests, and other questions you have about the game.
