# To Do List

## Website
1. Tighten up the accessibility and run through some tools.
2. Performance Optimizations
  - Pagespeed Insights
    - 99% Mobile, 100% Desktop
	- Serve images in nextgen formats.
	- Eliminate render blocking CSS and JS.
	  - â€¦css/all.css(use.fontawesome.com)
	  - /css/screen.css(spacejawns.com)
	  - /js/modernizr.min.js
  - Try .webp for mobile? Size savings is pretty incredible at about 1/10 optimized JPEG or PNG.
