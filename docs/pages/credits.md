description: Space Jawns Game Credits
---

I come from an open source background in software development, so naturally I have leaned towards using open source game art in Space Jawns. I have been learning a lot the past few months and have actually been making many of my own sounds and some other artwork, but I still have a bunch of people to thank for getting Space Jawns to where it is today.
