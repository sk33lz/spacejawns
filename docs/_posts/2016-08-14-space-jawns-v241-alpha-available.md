The latest Space Jawns release fixes a bug that was not allowing players to save their name properly before starting the game. This lead to some blank player names being saved on the [Space Jawns Top 100 High Scores](/top-100) list. You should now be prompted to add your name if it is blank and that name will update on your high score that is saved on the website the next time your score is updated.

There are no additional changes that I know of included in this release.

Check out the [Space Jawns download](/download) page to get the latest files.
