It took longer than I thought it would, over a month, but I have compelted migrating all of the legacy Unity GUI elements to the new Unity 4.6+ UI element. Using both systems together has been causing some odd display issues on different devices. The new UI system introduced in Unity 4.6 scales much better than the legacy GUI system from my testing, and that's what made me want to update all of the elements to the UI system in the first place. There are many other enhancements that went into this relase like new custom sound effects and visual effects. See the full Changelog for the 2.0.7 Alpha release below.
