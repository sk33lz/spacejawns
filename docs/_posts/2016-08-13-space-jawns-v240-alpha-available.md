As you may have noticed, there are a few minor version releases missing since the last release. I decided to just roll those changes into this release, as there was a lot of QA and testing that needed to be done before releasing another release after the 2.2.0-Alpha and 2.3.0-Alpha changes. There are also a few bug fixes and new features in the the full 2.4.0-Alpha release.

The first minor release, 2.2.0-Alpha, was that I converted all Space jawns game scripts to use C# instead of Javascript for a few reasons. One was that I just bought an asset that ony worked in C#, and the other is that C# is known for better performance over Javascript in games. Space Jawns is now fully scripted in C#. I'm looking forward to taking advantage of some of these new enhancements as the game matures. So far it the C# code has helped me be a better developer as it is much less forgiving than Javascript.

The second minor release, 2.3.0-Alpha, was that I upgraded All Space Jawns game scripts to be compatible with unity 5. This also has a bunch of enhancements over the previous version I was using to build the game, Unity 4.6. This was apparently meant to be, as I received an email from Unity a few days later about how Unity 4.6 would no longer be supported after 2015.

These processes have brought about a new life to Space Jawns, even in it's infancy, and have allowed me to fix some long standing bugs in the process as well.
