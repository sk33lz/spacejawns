Once again it took a bit longer than I expected to take for a new release, but I ran into some snags with some of the features I planned to release in 2.0.8-alpha. I figure it's better to include more features in a release, so hopefully that's ok with everyone else.

There are a ton of new features and updates with this release, so I'm just going to let the Changlog do most of the talking. Highlights from this release include a new ship energy system, Levels 7-10, increased randomization, and more skyboxes!

Changlog
- Added player ship energy system that depletes as weapons are fired.
  - The goal will be to limit shots so that people can't just spam fire.
    - Level 1 lasers have a rated power usage of 25 units.
    - Level 1 ships have a total power rating of 100. This will allow for 4 shots before requiring more energy.
    - Gain power capacity through level up and temporary powerups.
- Higher level weapons will do more damage and use more energy.
- This will obviously need tweaking as levels progress, especially past level 10.
- Added energy bar UI component to display current energy level with percentage of energy level text label.
- Added levels 7-10 with added incremental difficulty levels. These may need tweaking.
- Added additional level of randomization for game objects. Now all spawners have their own random spawn points.
  - So far this includes enemy ships, asteroids, turrets, and powerups.
  - All spawns will have this randomization to keep the game content fresh every play.
  - May need some tweaking.
- Added custom skybox created with SpaceScape for Levels 3, 4, and 5. More custom skyboxes coming soon!
  - jNebula_Skybox
