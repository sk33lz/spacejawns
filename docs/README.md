# Spacejawns Website

A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) powered static website with a performance optimized custom Jekyll theme based on the [Hydra Jekyll theme](https://github.com/CloudCannon/hydra-jekyll-template). Some additional features added from other Jekyll plugins, Jekyll themes, and open source code.

## Jekyll Plugins
- jekyll-archives
- jekyll-sitemap
- jekyll-seo-tag
- jekyll-feed
- jekyll-paginate

## Additional Features
- Integrates with [HighScoreAPI](https://github.com/sk33lz/highscoreapi), a lightweight Node.JS API I wrote for accessing high score data in a MySQL database.

## Credits
- Off-Canvas Accessible Responsive Menu https://medium.com/@heyoka/responsive-pure-css-off-canvas-hamburger-menu-aebc8d11d793

## Requirements
- Requires the [CORS_ALLOW_ORIGIN](https://github.com/sk33lz/highscoreapi#cors_allow_origin) environment variable to be configured in [HighScoreAPI](https://github.com/sk33lz/highscoreapi) for Top 100 to render without CORS errors.
